# 👨‍🏫 Online Courses

You can find a curated collection of online courses in this section. They are all free and of high quality.

There are two types of coures:&#x20;

**Classes:** They have a fix start date and you have to apply for them. You will have a teacher, who will answer your questions during the course. Perfect if you have enough time and just need a nudge, to (finally) get started ;)

**Online:** They consist mostly of articles and videos. There is no test upfront and you can start them right away and finish them in your own time.&#x20;
