## Rust&#x20;

[Rust](https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/wiki/Learning-Rust) is the primarily programming language used to develop Programs on Solana. [Native Rust ](https://solana.com/docs/programs/rust)refers to writing Solana programs without using frameworks like [Anchor](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/solana-anchor). This approach provides developers with direct control over their Solana programs. However, it requires more manual setup and boilerplate code compared to using the Anchor.

If you decide to go the rust way, it is recommended to start your journey with the Anchor framework.&#x20;

Anchor can help you write safe programs because it includes lots of checks that you would have to implement manually.

## Seahorse (Python)

There are also various community driven efforts to enable writing on-chain programs using other languages, including Python via [Seahorse](https://seahorse.dev/) (that acts as a wrapper the Rust based [Anchor framework](backend.md#example-programs))

## C/C++ <a href="#example-programs" id="example-programs"></a>

Although very limited, you can still build abstract Solana programs.&#x20;

You can also explore the [Program Examples](https://solana.com/docs/programs/examples) for examples of on-chain programs.
