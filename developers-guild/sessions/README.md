[Follow us on X](https://x.com/SuperteamDE) and [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/superteam-germany/) to make sure you don't miss a beat :relaxed:
{% endhint %}

Our guild holds meetings every two weeks, providing a platform for members to engage in meaningful discussions, share ideas, and collaborate on ongoing projects.

They are supposed to be deep dives for devs to learn something new and get a head start about the newest tech that gets released on Solana.

We stream those events on our [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@superteamde) channel, [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/superteamde) and X.
