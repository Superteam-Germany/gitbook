Our three-part series teaches you how you can mint NFTs on Solana with the new Metaplex Core standard and how you can use blinks to make the mint experience for your users even more appealing.

In this session we will lay down the basics:

* Introduction into Metaplex Core
* Live Demo:
  * Mint an NFT using TypeScript
  * Mint an NFT using Anchor Framework (Rust)
* AMA (ask any questions that are left)

We will be joined by [Leo](https://x.com/L0STE\_) who works as a community developer for [Metaplex](https://x.com/metaplex).
