<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We are hosting a 3 day hackathon bootcamp and will be streaming some of the sessions online.

There will be @LEâ—Ž having an incredible Metaplex Core session, @Wealthineer talking about user stories, Nick talking about Blinks thereby releasing some alpha that hasn't been out yet and much more.

## Sign Up

There are two types to participate in the event. If you want to get out the most of it, incl. office hours and networking, we recommend you to signup for our IRL event.&#x20;

But if you can't make it in person, we are also streaming some of the events on YouTube, Twitch and X.
