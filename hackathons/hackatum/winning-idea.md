# üèÜ Winning Idea?

The idea you choose for a hackathon can make all the difference between winning and just participating. We have gathered you great tips from our friend [Kash](https://x.com/kashdhanda)'s podcast from [Superteam](https://x.com/superteam):

* **Look for problems, not buzzwords**:&#x20;
  * Buzzwords: <mark style="color:red;">Metaverse, Artificial Intelligence, Hyperautomation, Quantum Computing.</mark>
  * Problems: <mark style="color:green;">Payments, DeFi, Community, Developer Tooling, User Onboarding.</mark>
* **Is the solution significantly better with adding crypto or would it be better without it?**
  * Build something that would make sense because of crypto.&#x20;
* **Is it a net positive to the ecosystem? Will it bring more users/liquidity?**
  * Don't focus on building something assuming there are tons of users ready to use it, rather build something of use case right here and now.
* **Look for Solana-specific ideas**:&#x20;
  * "You get instant points if you've built something that can only be built on Solana, that others chains couldn't handle" - Co-Founder @[Helius](https://www.helius.dev/).&#x20;
  * Build something that benefits from Solana's unique characteristics, such as transactions speed, composability and ascending markets use cases.
* **Make a functional UI:**&#x20;
  * It doesn't not have to be beautiful, just construct something practical, something that judges can feel, that is better to look at than an API.
* **Spend more than 20% of your time on your presentation:**
  * People do not look at your code first.&#x20;
  * Make your presentation interesting.&#x20;
  * Try to include a demo video.

Lastly, build something <mark style="color:orange;">cool</mark>..
