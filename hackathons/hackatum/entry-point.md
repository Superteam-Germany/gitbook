# â˜• Entry Point

Make sure to have checked out the refresher on the [fundamentals of Blockchain](../../developers-guild/knowledge-base/online-courses/for-beginners.md#what-exactly-is-blockchain) before going forward.

### First,

It is very much essential to first have the [Solana CLI](../../developers-guild/knowledge-base/sdk-overview/base.md) installed, so that you can debug and manage your Solana Programs,

### What does a typical Solana Project look like?

1. [**Client-Side Interface**](../../developers-guild/knowledge-base/sdk-overview/frontend.md)[ **(Frontend)**](../../developers-guild/knowledge-base/sdk-overview/frontend.md): Provides user interaction and displays data.
2. [**Solana Programs (Backend)**](../../developers-guild/knowledge-base/sdk-overview/backend.md): Executes transactions and processes data on the Solana network.
3. **Wallet Integration**: Facilitates user access and transaction approval.

### Why reinvent the wheel? [Anchor](../../developers-guild/knowledge-base/sdk-overview/backend.md#example-programs) :anchor: does the heavy lifting for you!

While you can build and deploy Solana Programs on Rust [natively](../../developers-guild/knowledge-base/sdk-overview/backend.md#rust) and even [C/C++](../../developers-guild/knowledge-base/sdk-overview/backend.md#example-programs-1), it is highly recommended to start with [Anchor](../../developers-guild/knowledge-base/sdk-overview/backend.md#example-programs), a framework for quickly building secure Solana programs. It handles both (de)serialization and security checks for you, so you can spend more time working on what matters **most**, your **product**.
