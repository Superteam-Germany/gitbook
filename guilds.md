Guilds are groups that are highly focused on specific areas throughout the blockchain domain. An artist might have a different interest in Blockchain technology than a developer or a validator.

To ensure we can offer you the best support, we decided to build small groups in which we can meet regularly to discuss the latest trends and learn from each other.

We kick-off with two guilds and plan to extend it to more guilds, as we see growing interest from you in certain areas.&#x20;

Our meetings take place every two weeks and will be announced via [X, so make sure you follow us](https://x.com/SuperteamDE).
